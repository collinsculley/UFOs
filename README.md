## Analysis

Module 11 introduces Javascript to our webscraping and bootstrap visiualization tools.  Javascript, html, and css files were all created in VScode in structured file organization.  Raw data and app.js file can be found in the 'js' folder within static.  Index.html contains the bootstrap features used to present the data with filtration functions.  The site provides a visual upgrade with filtering functionality for end-user aesthetics.  The filtering function applies to 5 columns.  Since the major coding legwork has been completed, adding additional functionality to filter all columns would not be difficult.  Conditional formatting could be used to filter loosly defined 'comments' sections since exact user input would be difficult to return exact matches.  A larger raw data source would also open up the possibility for further filtration.
